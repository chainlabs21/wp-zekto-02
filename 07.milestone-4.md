# Milestone 4 – June 2027: Future-Proof Infrastructure

## 6.1 Quantum-Resistant Cryptography

To address long-term security risks, KONET introduces **post-quantum cryptographic primitives** for signatures and key exchange, ensuring durability against advances in quantum computing.

KONET introduces post-quantum cryptographic schemes in a **hybrid mode**, allowing gradual migration.

### Key Principles

* Backward compatibility with classical cryptography
* Algorithm agility to swap primitives as standards mature
* Protection of long-lived assets and identities

This ensures cryptographic durability for decades-long systems.

## 6.2 AI-Assisted Network Monitoring and Resource Optimization

AI-driven analytics will be applied to:

* Real-time anomaly and attack detection
* Predictive capacity planning
* Automated performance tuning

This enables a **self-optimizing blockchain network** with reduced operational overhead.

### Continuous Analysis

AI systems continuously analyze:

* Validator behavior
* Network latency patterns
* Resource utilization

### Enabled Capabilities

These systems enable:

* Early anomaly and attack detection
* Predictive scaling decisions
* Automated tuning of block parameters and resource allocation

The result is a **self-observing, self-optimizing blockchain network** with reduced human intervention.

## 6.3 Hardware Acceleration

KONET supports **hardware-accelerated cryptography and ZK proof computation** using GPUs, FPGAs, and secure hardware modules, improving throughput, cost efficiency, and energy performance.

KONET is designed to offload computationally intensive tasks to specialized hardware.

### Accelerated Components

* Cryptographic operations
* ZK proof generation and verification
* Secure key handling via hardware security modules (HSMs)

### Supported Hardware

* GPUs for parallel proof computation
* FPGAs for custom cryptographic pipelines
* Secure enclaves for key isolation

This dramatically improves performance efficiency and operational cost predictability.
