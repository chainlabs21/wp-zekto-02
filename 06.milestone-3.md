# Milestone 3 – December 2026: Trust, Privacy, and Interoperability

## 5.1 Privacy Phase 2

Privacy Phase 2 leverages advanced zero-knowledge proof systems to protect:

* Transaction participants
* Transaction amounts
* On-chain state transitions

while still enabling **selective disclosure** for compliance and regulatory oversight.

### Full Transaction-Level Confidentiality

Privacy Phase 2 introduces **full transaction-level confidentiality** using advanced zero-knowledge proofs.

Protected elements include:

* Sender and recipient identities
* Transaction values
* State transition logic

### Selective Disclosure

Selective disclosure mechanisms allow:

* Regulated entities to prove compliance
* Auditors to verify correctness without accessing raw data
* Lawful access under governance-approved conditions

This balances strong privacy with institutional accountability.

## 5.2 Cross-Chain Interoperability

KONET evolves into a **multi-chain–connected network**, enabling secure asset and data movement across heterogeneous blockchains. This allows developers and institutions to deploy applications that operate seamlessly across ecosystems.

### Security-First Design

KONET's cross-chain design prioritizes **security over convenience**.

Interoperability mechanisms include:

* Light-client–based verification where possible
* Message-passing protocols with cryptographic finality checks
* Bridge governance aligned with validator consensus

Rather than acting as a single isolated chain, KONET becomes a **connected execution and settlement layer** spanning multiple ecosystems.

## 5.3 Decentralized Identity (DID)

KONET integrates **Decentralized Identity (DID)** as a foundational trust layer, enabling:

* User-sovereign identity management
* Verifiable credentials
* Secure interaction between on-chain and off-chain services

This is particularly critical for finance, public services, and regulated digital interactions.

### Protocol-Level Trust Primitive

DID is integrated as a **protocol-level trust primitive**, not merely an application feature.

Core capabilities:

* On-chain identity anchors
* Verifiable credentials with off-chain storage
* Cryptographic linkage between identities and accounts

### Enabled Interactions

This enables secure interaction between:

* Users and applications
* Institutions and citizens
* On-chain logic and off-chain systems

DID becomes the foundation for regulated access, compliance workflows, and trust-aware smart contracts.
